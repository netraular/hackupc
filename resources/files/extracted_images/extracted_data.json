Even on routes with-\nout signs, the system can, if necessary, display\nthe applicable speed limits.\nRoad sign recognition does not work in all\ncountries. Keep this in mind when travelling\nabroad.\nThe additional signs are displayed on the\nHead-up-Display and on the instrument clus-\nter as generic additional signs.\nShown on the display\nFig. 7  On the instrument cluster display:\nexample of speed limits with a generic\nadditional sign.\nIn Germany, on motorways and normal roads\nfor vehicles, besides speed limits and overtak-\ning provisions the system also displays end of\nrestriction signs.

For system reasons, a\ngeneric sign is displayed instead of the actual\ndetected sign.\nThe valid road sign is displayed on the Head-\nup-Display by the generic additional sign.\nThe warning sign display is not available in all\ncountries and the system may not be able to\ndetect all existing warning signs.\nNo entry sign\nThe road sign recognition system gives a warn-\ning on the instrument cluster when a no entry\nsign is passed on a one-way road or an en-\ntrance to a motorway or highway.\n",

This is why it is so\nimportant to fasten seat belts before every trip,\neven when \"just driving around the corner\".\nEnsure that your passengers wear their seat\nbelts as well. Accident statistics have shown\nthat wearing seat belts is an effective means of\nsubstantially reducing the risk of injury and im-\nproving the chances of survival when involved\nin a serious accident. Furthermore, properly\nworn seat belts improve the protection provi-\nded by airbags in the event of an accident. For\nthis reason, wearing a seat belt is required by\nlaw in most countries.\nAlthough your vehicle is equipped with airbags,\nthe seat belts must be fastened and worn. The\nfront airbags, for example, are only triggered in\nsome cases of head-on collision. The front air-\nbags will not be triggered during minor head-\non or side collisions, rear-end collisions, over-\nturns or accidents in which the airbag trigger\nthreshold value in the control unit is not ex-\nceeded.\nImportant safety instructions for the use of\nseat belts\n●Always wear the seat belt as described in this\nsection.\n●Ensure that the seat belts can be fastened at\nall times and are not damaged.\nWARNING\n●If seat belts are worn incorrectly or not at\nall, the risk of severe injuries increases. The\noptimal protection from seat belts can be\nachieved only if you use them properly.\n●Never allow two passengers (even children)\nto share the same seat belt.\n●Never unbuckle a seat belt while the vehi-\ncle is in motion. Risk of fatal injury.\n●The seat belt should never lie on hard or\nfragile objects (such as glasses or pens, etc.)\nbecause this can cause injuries.\n●Do not allow the seat belt to be damaged or\njammed, or to rub on any sharp edges.\n●Never wear the seat belt under the arm or\nin any other incorrect position.\n●Bulky and unfastened clothing (such as an\novercoat over a sweater) impairs the proper\nfit and function of the seat belts, reducing\ntheir ability to protect.\n●The slot in the seat belt buckle must not be\nblocked with paper or other objects, as this\ncan prevent the latch plate from engaging\nsecurely.\n● Never use seat belt clips, fastening rings or\nsimilar items to alter the position of the belt\nwebbing.\n●Frayed or torn seat belts or damage to\nthe connections, belt retractors or parts of\nthe buckle could cause severe injuries in the\nevent of an accident. Therefore, you must\ncheck the condition of all seat belts at regu-\nlar intervals.\n●Seat belts which have been worn in an ac-\ncident and have been stretched must be re-\nplaced by a specialised workshop. Renewal\nmay be necessary even if there is no appa-\nrent damage. The belt anchorage should also\nbe checked.\n●Do not attempt to repair a damaged seat\nbelt yourself.

The taller\nthey are, the more energy there is to be “ab-\nsorbed” in the event of an accident.\nThe most significant factor, however, is the\nspeed of the vehicle.

If a rear-end\ncollision is highly likely, the functions of the\nPreCrash system may also be activated. In this\nsituation, the hazard warning lights are turned\non with a higher frequency of flashes.\n",

But unlike adults, children do not\nhave fully developed muscle and bone struc-\ntures. This means that children are subject to a\ngreater risk of injury.\nTo reduce the risk of injuries, children must\nalways use special child restraint systems when\ntravelling in the vehicle.\nWe recommend the use of child safety\nproducts from the Genuine Accessories Pro-\ngramme, which includes systems for all ages\n(see www.cupraaccessories.com).\nThese systems have been especially de-\nsigned and approved and comply with the\nUN ECE R129 (i-Size) regulation.\nCUPRA recommends securing the child seats\nshown on the website as described below:\n●Rear-facing child seat (group 0+): ISOFIX and\nsupport leg (Britax Römer Baby-Safe 3 i-SIZE +\nFlex Base i-SENSE).\n●Forward-facing child seat (group 1): ISOFIX\nAND Top Tether (Britax Römer TRIFIX 2 i-Size).\n●Forward-facing child seat (group 2): seat belt\nand ISOFIX (Britax Römer KIDFIX i-Size). You\nmust also use the seat’s “Secure-Guard” seat-\nbelt connection point and adjust the side im-\npact protection system “SICT” (available on\ncertain models), located in the seat backrest.\nAdjust only the “SICT” closest to the door.\nPlease follow the child seat manufacturer's us-\nage instructions.\n●Forward-facing child seat (group 3): seat belt\nand ISOFIX (Britax Römer KIDFIX i-Size). Group\n3 can use the seat with backrest or only the\nseat base without the backrest (booster). The\nbackrest of the child seat has an adult seat belt\nguide and a head restraint, meaning that the\nseat with the backrest offers better protection\nthan boosters without backrests.

They\nare valid for all child seats regardless of their\nattachment system.\n●Please read and follow the child seat manu-\nfacturer's operating instructions.\n●The child seat should preferably be fitted to\nthe rear seat behind the front passenger seat\nso that the child can exit the vehicle on the\npavement side.\n●Set the height of the seat belt such that\nit adapts to the child seat naturally, without\ntwisting. The lowest position of the seat belt\nheight regulator must be used with rear-facing\nchild seats.\n●To correctly use a child seat in the back, the\nfront backrest must be adjusted so that there is\nno contact with the child seat in the back if it is\nrear facing. In the case of front facing restraint\nsystems, the front backrest must be adjusted\nso that there is no contact with the child's feet.\n●For a correct assembly of the child's seat on\nthe rear seats, adjust or dismount the head-\nrest, in order to prevent contact with the seat.\n●If a semi-universal type seat is to be installed,\nin which the method of attachment to the car\nis through the seat belt and support bracket,\nit should never be installed in the central rear\nseat as the ground clearance is lower than in\nother places and the support bracket will not\nallow the seat to remain sufficiently stable.\nImportant information about the front pas-\nsenger airbag\nA sticker with important information about the\npassenger airbag is located on the passenger's\nsunshade blind and/or on the passenger side\ndoor frame ››› Fig. 35.\nRead and always observe the safety informa-\ntion included in the following chapters:\n●Safety distance with respect to the passenger\nairbag ››› page 48.\n●Objects between the passenger and the pas-\nsenger side airbag ››› \n in Front airbags on\npage 52.\nThe passenger side front airbag, when ena-\nbled, is a serious risk for a rear-facing child\nsince the airbag can strike the seat with such\nforce that it can cause serious or fatal injuries.\nChildren up to 12 years old should always travel\non the rear seat.\nTherefore we strongly recommend that you\ntransport children on the rear seats. This is the\nsafest location in the vehicle. Alternatively, the\nfront passenger airbag can be disabled with a\nkey-operated switch ››› page 52. When trans-\nporting children, use a child seat suitable for\nthe age and size of each child ››› page 57.\n",

Risk of poten-\ntially fatal injuries to the child! However, if\nnecessary, the front passenger airbag must\nbe deactivated››› page 52.\n●For those vehicles that do not include a key\nlock switch to deactivate the airbag, the vehi-\ncle must be taken to a technical service. Do\nnot forget to reconnect the airbag when an\nadult wants to sit in the front passenger seat.\n●Never allow a child to be transported in a\nvehicle without being properly secured, or\nto stand up or kneel on a seat while travel-\nling. In an accident, the child could be flung\nthrough the vehicle, causing possibly fatal in-\njuries to themselves and to the other vehicle\noccupants.\n●Never leave a child alone in the child seat\nor in the vehicle.\n●Children who are less than 1.50 m tall must\nnot wear a normal seat belt without a child\nseat, as this could cause injuries to the ab-\ndominal and neck areas during a sudden\nbraking manoeuvre or in an accident.\n●When a child seat is mounted in the rear\nseats, the door's child lock should be activa-\nted.\nAttachment systems\nDepending on the country, different attach-\nment systems are used for safely installing child\nseats.\nAttachment systems overview\n●ISOFIX: ISOFIX is a standardised attachment\nsystem allowing quick and safe attachment of\nchild seats in the vehicle. ISOFIX attachment\nestablishes a rigid connection between the\nchild seat and the car body.\nThe child seat has two rigid attachment clips,\ncalled connectors. These connectors are fit-\nted into the ISOFIX attachment rings found\nbetween the seat cushion and the backrest\nof the vehicle's back seat (on the sides). ISO-\nFIX attachment systems are used mainly in Eu-\nrope ››› page 60. If necessary, ISOFIX at-\ntachment may have to be supplemented with a\nTop Tether belt or a support bracket.\n●Automatic three-point seat belt. Whenever\npossible, it is preferable to attach the child\nseats with the ISOFIX system rather than at-\ntaching them with an automatic three-point\nseat belt ››› page 64.\nAdditional attachment:\n●Top Tether: the Top Tether belt is guided\nover the back of the rear seat and attached to\nan anchor point with a hook. Anchor points are\nlocated at the back of the rear seat backrest on\nthe luggage compartment side ››› page 63.\nThe rings for retaining the Top Tether belt are\nmarked with an anchor symbol.\n●Support bracket: some child seats rest on\nthe floor of the vehicle with a support bracket.\nThe support bracket prevents the child seat\nfrom tipping forward in the event of impact.\nChild seats fitted with a support bracket should\nonly be used in the passenger seat and side\nrear seats ››› \n. For the assembly of this type\nof seat you should also consult the list of ap-\nproved vehicles for this assembly, available in\nthe instructions for child restraint systems.\nRecommended systems for attaching child\nseats\nCUPRA recommends attaching child seats as\nfollows:\n●Baby carriers or rear facing child seats:\nISOFIX and support bracket or i-Size.\n●Forward-facing child seats: ISOFIX and Top\nTether.\n",

The\ncharging time decreases significantly. Please\nnote the information on charging frequently\nwith direct current (DC) ››› \n.\nProtection against current leakage\nThe vehicle is fitted with a direct current (DC)\nleakage protection device. This prevents any\ncurrent leakage that may occur during charg-\ning from reaching the house's electrically in-\nstallation through the charging cable.\nWARNING\nIf the battery is charged in an inappropri-\nate manner, if no consideration is given to\nthe appropriate safety measures or the high-\nvoltage battery is used in an inadequate\nmanner, this could lead to short circuits,\nelectrical shocks, explosions, fires, burns and\nserious injuries, and even death.\n●Always respect the stipulated order of the\noperations to avoid the risk of suffering an\nelectric shock or serious injuries due to the\nresidual energy in the charging accumulator.\n●Please observe the safety and handling\ninstructions of the charging cable supplied\nwith the vehicle ››› page 90.\n●When charging, only use power sockets\nthat are appropriately fitted, have been\nchecked and are not damaged, as well as\nelectrical installations that are in perfect\nworking order. Duly qualified technicians\nshould check the power sockets and the\nelectrical installation on a regular basis.\n●Never charge the vehicle in places where\nthere is a danger of explosion. The compo-\nnents of the charging cable can cause sparks\nand, therefore, may ignite flammable fumes\nor explosives.\n●Always protect the connectors from mois-\nture and from water and other fluids getting\ninside directly.\n●For safety reasons, never perform other\nworks on the vehicle while charging.\n●Always complete the charging process be-\nfore unplugging the connector from the\nelectrical network. Otherwise the charging\ncable and the electrical installation may also\nbe damaged.\nWARNING\nIf the vehicle is driven with a very low charge\nlevel of the high-voltage battery, the vehicle\nmay stall in traffic, causing serious damage or\naccidents and injuries.\n",

These areas outside the field of view are\nknown as the blind spot. Other road users and\nobjects may be in the blind spot.\nWARNING\nAdjusting the exterior mirrors and interior\nmirror while driving can distract the driver.\nThis could cause accidents and lead to seri-\nous injuries\n●Only adjust the exterior mirrors and inte-\nrior mirror when the vehicle is stationary.\n●When parking, changing lanes, overtaking\nor turning, always keep a close eye on your\nsurroundings, as other road users or objects\nmay also be in the blind spot.\n●Always make sure that the mirrors are ad-\njusted correctly and that visibility to the rear\nis not reduced by ice, snow, fogging or other\nobjects.\nWARNING\nA failure to accurately estimate the distance\nto vehicles driving behind can lead to serious\naccidents and injuries.\n●Curved (convex or aspherical) mirrors in-\ncrease the field of view and objects in them\nappear smaller and further away.\n●Curved mirrors do not allow you to pre-\ncisely calculate the distance to vehicles driv-\ning behind, so using them when changing\nlanes could cause serious accidents and inju-\nries.\n●If possible, use the interior mirror to pre-\ncisely calculate the distance to vehicles driv-\ning behind you, or to other objects.\n●Always make sure you have sufficient visi-\nbility to the rear.\nWARNING\nThe automatic anti-dazzle mirrors contain an\nelectrolyte fluid which could leak if the mir-\nror is broken.\n●If it gets out, the electrolyte fluid can\nirritate the skin, eyes and respiratory or-\ngans, particularly in the case of people with\nasthma or similar diseases. Immediately in-\nhale enough fresh air and get out of the vehi-\ncle, or open all windows and doors if this is\nnot possible.\n●If the electrolyte fluid comes into contact\nwith your eyes or skin, immediately rinse the\naffected area with plenty of water for at least\n15 minutes and seek medical advice.\n●If the fluid comes into contact with foot-\nwear or clothing, rinse immediately with\nplenty of water for at least 15 minutes. Clean\nthoroughly before using the footwear or\nclothing in question again.\n●If the electrolyte fluid is swallowed, imme-\ndiately rinse the mouth with plenty of water\nfor at least 15 minutes. Do not induce vomit-\ning unless advised by a doctor. Immediately\nseek medical attention.\n",

If a\ngreat deal of heat accumulates in the interior,\nventilating it can accelerate the cooling proc-\ness.\nSome functions and menu tabs depend on the\nequipment.\nOperating the air conditioning with voice\ncommands\nDepending on the equipment, some of the\nair conditioning functions can be operated by\nvoice control ››› page 263.\nPassenger recognition function\nThe passenger recognition function turns\ndown the air conditioning in these areas if no\noccupation is detected in them, with the aim\nof reducing the vehicle’s energy consumption.\nWhen the drive system is on, the vehicle rec-\nognises whether a person is sitting in a seat in\nthe vehicle with a seatbelt fastened.\nThe turning down of the air conditioning is in-\ndicated as follows:\n●Front passenger area: on the front passenger\ntemperature setting, which will display ECO in-\nstead of the selected temperature.\n●Rear area: On the rear temperature setting,\nwhere ECO will be displayed instead of the se-\nlected temperature. This turning down of the\nair conditioning will also be displayed on the\ncontrol located in the rear area.\nDust and pollen filter\nThe dust and pollen filter with its activated\ncharcoal cartridge serves as a barrier against\nimpurities in the air taken into the vehicle inte-\nrior.\nThe dust and pollen filter must be changed\nregularly so that air conditioner performance is\nnot adversely affected.\nIf the filter loses efficiency prematurely due\nto use in areas with very high levels of air\npollution, the filter must be changed more fre-\nquently than stated in the Service Schedule.\nWARNING\nReduced visibility through the windows in-\ncreases the risk of serious accidents.\n●Always ensure that all windows are free of\nice and snow, and that they are not fogged,\nso as to maintain good visibility of everything\noutside.\n●Only drive when you have good visibility.\n●Always ensure that you use the air condi-\ntioner and heated rear window to maintain\ngood visibility.\n●Never leave the air recirculation on for a\nlong period of time.

The lane departure warn-\ning will not work at speeds of less than approx.\n15 km/h (9 mph).\nLane width is not detected individually, but is\nrather pre-configured in the system. Thus if\nyou are driving in wide lanes or in between\ntwo lanes, the indications may be incorrect.\nFurthermore, the system can detect vehicles\ndriving in the lane next to you (if there are any),\nand can also detect stationary objects such as\ndividers, and thus give an incorrect indication.\nTrailer mode\nSide assist is automatically deactivated and\ncannot be switched on if the factory-fitted\ntow-bar is electrically connected to a trailer or\nsimilar device.\nAs soon as the driver starts to drive with a\ntrailer connected electrically to the vehicle, a\nmessage is displayed on the instrument cluster\ndisplay indicating that side assist is switched\noff. Once the vehicle trailer has been disen-\ngaged, side assist will return to the initial state\nprior to the moment the trailer was electrically\nconnected.\nIf the tow-bar is not factory fitted, side assist\nshould be switched off manually when driving\nwith a trailer.\nPhysical limitations inherent to the system\nIn some situations the lane departure warning\nmay not interpret the traffic situation correctly.\nI.e. in the following situations:\n●on tight bends;\n●in the case of lanes with different widths;\n●in areas with significant gradient changes;\n●in adverse weather conditions;\n●in the case of special constructions to the\nside of the vehicle, e.g., high or irregular divid-\ners.\n",

Connectivity components that are not\npart of the equipment of all of the vehicles\nparticularly include:\n●Connection socket for diagnosis.\n● Control unit with an integrated eSIM card\n(OCU).\n● Telephone interface.\n●Full Link.\n●NFC wireless communication technology.\n●Bluetooth Interface®.\n●USB (connection).\n●Transreceiver module.\nThe connectivity components are key points\nin cybersecurity. Connectivity components are\nalso fitted with security mechanisms that min-\nimise the risk of unauthorised third parties\ngaining access to vehicle systems.\nSecurity mechanisms\nSoftware and locking mechanisms mounted on\nthe vehicle are being developed continuously.\nAs in the case of computers or mobile phone\ndevice operating systems, software and lock-\ning mechanisms mounted on the vehicle can\nalso be updated non-periodically. In general,\nsoftware updates improve the security, stability\nand speed of execution of vehicle systems that\nhave already been manufactured.\nMinimising risks\nYou can contribute to reducing the risk of un-\nauthorized third parties accessing the vehicle\nsystems and their functions:\n●Do not use data storage devices, Bluetooth®\ndevices or mobile phone devices that contain\nmanipulated data or malicious software in the\nvehicle.\n●Immediately install the system updates provi-\nded by CUPRA.\n●Only get vehicle repair and maintenance\nwork done at specialised workshops. CUPRA\nrecommends visiting a CUPRA dealership for\nthis purpose.\nWARNING\nThe risk of unauthorised third parties gaining\naccess to vehicle functions, data and con-\ntrol units through malware or an attack over\nthe Internet cannot be ruled out despite the\nvehicle's security mechanisms. If malicious\nsoftware is introduced into the vehicle, it can\ninfluence, deactivate or control the control\nunits and vehicle functions and cause serious\naccidents and fatal injuries.\n●If the vehicle operates differently than\nusual or reacts or behaves strangely, reduce\nspeed immediately (where possible) in a con-\ntrolled manner and drive to the nearest spe-\ncialist workshop without delay, or seek the\nassistance of specialist personnel.\n●Malicious software can also access data and\ninformation stored in control units, the in-\nfotainment system, connected data storage\ndevices and paired mobile phone devices.\nWARNING\nComputers, data storage devices and mobile\nphone devices that connect to the Internet\nor that are used on public or private networks\ncan be infected by manipulated data and ma-\nlicious software.\n●Protect your computer, data media and\nmobile phone devices with a suitable anti-vi-\nrus program and by taking widespread pre-\ncautionary measures.\n",

Such data can also pro-\nvide (at least indirectly) information about the\ndriver in question, for example, driving behav-\niour and location. As a contracting party in the\nCUPRA CONNECT contract with SEAT, S.A.,\nyou must ensure that when your vehicle is\nused by other drivers (for example, family or\nfriends), data protection and personal rights\nare respected. Therefore, you must inform\ndrivers in advance that the vehicle transfers\nand receives data online, and that you can ac-\ncess such data.\nFailure to take this obligation to inform into ac-\ncount can infringe certain rights of the occu-\npants.\nPersonal information\nCUPRA protects your personal data and only\nuses them as permitted by law, or if you have\ngiven your consent to a certain use. Detailed\ninformation on data processing in connection\nwith the CUPRA CONNECT services can be\nfound in the Data Protection Declaration, the\ncurrent version of which can be accessed on\nthe CUPRA website.\nPermanent transfer of the vehicle\nIf the vehicle has been purchased used or\nsomeone else has left the vehicle to you\nfor permanent use, CUPRA CONNECT may al-\nready be activated and the previous primary\nuser may still be able to access the data regis-\ntered via CUPRA CONNECT and control certain\nfunctions of your vehicle.\nYou can automatically remove the previous pri-\nmary user by registering yourself as the primary\nuser of the vehicle. Alternatively, you can re-\nstore the infotainment system to factory set-\ntings (\n > Restore factory settings) or set the\nvehicle to offline mode (››› page 247) and\ntherefore limit both your vehicle's communica-\ntion with the CUPRA data service and the pro-\ncessing of personal and vehicle data.\nDeactivating CUPRA CONNECT\nservices\nThe following functions are available to ac-\ntivate and deactivate the CUPRA CONNECT\nservices:\n● Allow or prevent data transmissions through\nthe infotainment system ››› page 247, Pri-\nvacy mode.\n●Wherever possible: individual deactivation or\nactivation through your user account in the My\nCUPRA App.\nYou can run the relevant services again after\ncancelling their deactivation.\nNote\nThe services required by law and their data\ntransmission cannot be disconnected or de-\nactivated, for example, the emergency call\nsystem (eCall).\nFaults\nEven if the prerequisites for the use of CUPRA\nCONNECT services are met, there may be fac-\ntors beyond the control of CUPRA that inter-\nfere with the execution of such services or pre-\nvent them. specifically including:\n● Maintenance, repair, deactivation, software\nupdate and technical expansion of telecom-\nmunication equipment, satellites, servers and\ndata banks.\n●Change of the mobile telephony standard for\nmobile data transmission by the telecommuni-\ncations service provider, e.g. from LTE or UMTS\nto EDGE or GPRS.\n●Disconnection of an existing mobile phone\nstandard by the telecommunications service\nprovider.\n●Interference, disturbance or interruption of\nmobile and GPS signal reception due to as-\npects such as high speed driving, solar storms,\nmeteorological influences, topography, jam-\nming equipment and intensive mobile phone\nuse in the radio cells in question.\n",

Only\nthe image of the rear view camera system can\nbe displayed during system start-up.\n●The display of all indications and the execu-\ntion of functions only takes place once the in-\nfotainment system has finished booting. The\nduration of the system booting depends on\nthe number of infotainment functions and may\ntake longer than normal in the event of very\nhigh or very low temperatures.\n●When using the infotainment system and\ncorresponding accessories, e.g., headphones,\nbear in mind country-specific regulations and\nlegal provisions.\n●The online navigation, online voice com-\nmand and Internet Radio functions (among\nothers) require the activation of CUPRA CON-\nNECT Gen4 services (linked to the CUPRA\nCONNECT PLUS pack) and an Internet con-\nnection for the vehicle. The data transmission\nmust not be limited to perform the functions.\n●To use the infotainment system, simply lightly\npress a button or touch the screen.\n●For the correct operation of the infotain-\nment system it is important that it is switched\non and that, if necessary, the time and date of\nthe vehicle are set correctly.\n●If a function button is missing on the screen,\nit is not a device defect, but corresponds to the\nspecific equipment of the country or version.\n●Some infotainment functions can only be se-\nlected when the vehicle is at a standstill. In\nsome countries, the gear selector must also be\nin parking position P or neutral N. This is not\na malfunction, but is due to compliance with\nlegal requirements.\n●Restrictions on the use of devices using\nBluetooth® technology may apply in some\ncountries. For further information, contact the\nlocal authorities.\n●If you disconnect the 12-volt battery, turn on\nthe ignition before restarting the infotainment\nsystem.\n●If the setup is changed, this may change the\ndisplay on the screen and in some cases, the\ninfotainment system may behave in a manner\ndifferent to that described in this instruction\nmanual.\n●When the drive system is switched off and\nthe charge level of the vehicle’s 12 V battery is\nlow, the infotainment system switches off auto-\nmatically.\n●Ensure that any repairs or modifications that\nneed to be carried out on the infotainment\nsystem are carried out by a specialised work-\nshop. To do so, CUPRA recommends going to a\nspecialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealer-\nship.\n●Using a mobile phone device inside the vehi-\ncle may cause noise in the speakers.\n●On vehicles with park assist, the audio\nsource volume is automatically lowered when\nreverse gear is selected. The volume reduction\ncan be adjusted.\n●Information about the included software and\nthe license conditions can be found in Set-\ntings > Information > Copyright.\n●When selling or lending the vehicle, make\nsure that all saved data, files and settings have\nbeen deleted and, if necessary, external audio\nsources and data media have been removed.\nRemember to also restore the factory settings\nto unlink your CUPRA ID username from the\nvehicle, as well as your CUPRA CONNECT\nGen4 pack.\nNote\nYou will find more information and tips for\nusing the infotainment system in the Help\nmenu.\nNote\nThe functions and menus shown in this man-\nual correspond to a left-hand drive vehicle.\nIn a right-hand drive vehicle, some functions\nand menus will be on the opposite side of the\nscreen.\n",

Both drivers should be\nwell informed of the special features of towing.\nInexperienced drivers should refrain from tow-\ning.\nDuring towing, make sure at all times that no\ninadmissible pulling forces or jolts are caused.\nOn roads without a firm surface there is always\nthe danger of overloading the attachment\nparts.\nObserve the legal provisions regarding towing.\nTowing\nTowing means a vehicle pulling another vehicle\nthat is not in a condition to drive.\nThe vehicle can be towed with a tow bar or\ncable.\n●The speed limit is 50 km/h (30 mph).\n●The maximum permitted distance is 50 km\n(30 miles).\nTow cable and tow bar\nIt is safer for the vehicle to be towed using a\ntow bar, avoiding damage to the vehicle. The\ntow cable should only be used if a tow bar is\nnot available.\nA tow rope should be slightly elastic to avoid\ndamage to both vehicles. It is advisable to use\na tow rope made of synthetic fibre or similarly\nelastic material.\nTowing with a tow truck\nThe vehicle may only be transported on a tow\ntruck if all four wheels are supported.\nDeactivating roll-away protection\n››› page 205\nIf necessary, to release the parking brake so\nthat the vehicle can be pushed or towed:\n●Keep the brake pedal pressed down and se-\nlect the N position on the gear selector. Next,\nconfirm Deactivate roll-away protection in\nthe Infotainment System.\n●OR: open the vehicle settings in the infotain-\nment system \n > Settings > Brakes > Deacti-\nvate the “Roll-away protection” function.\nWARNING\nWhen towing a vehicle, the driving behaviour\nand braking capacity change considerably.\nWARNING\nNever allow the vehicle to be towed if it has\nno power.\n●When towing, never switch off the ignition\nwith the ignition/start button. Otherwise, the\nelectronic lock of the steering column could\nsuddenly get blocked and it would be impos-\nsible to steer the vehicle. This could cause an\naccident, serious injury and loss of control of\nthe vehicle.\n●If the vehicle runs out of power during tow-\ning, stop the process immediately and seek\nthe assistance of specialised personnel.\n",

Correct tyre pressure is very important\n››› page 334.\nTo avoid damage to tyres and wheels, drive\nwith special care when driving on roads in poor\ncondition.\nVisually check your wheels every 3000 km.\nIf the tyres or rims have received a heavy im-\npact or have been damaged, have a special-\nised workshop check whether or not it is nec-\nessary to change the tyre.\nLow profile tyres may deteriorate more quickly\nthan standard tyres.\nConcealed damage\nDamage to tyres and rims is often not readily\nvisible. If you notice unusual vibration or the\ncar pulling to one side, this may indicate that\none of the tyres is damaged. Reduce speed im-\nmediately if there is any reason to suspect that\ndamage may have occurred. Inspect the tyres\nfor damage. If no external damage is visible,\ndrive slowly and carefully to the nearest speci-\nalised workshop and have the car inspected.\nForeign objects inserted in the tyre\n●Do not remove foreign bodies if they have\npenetrated through the tyre wall!\n●Use a specialised workshop for repair or re-\nplacement. CUPRA recommends going to a\nspecialised CUPRA dealer or any SEAT dealer-\nship for this purpose.\nThe sealant inside the tyre tread wraps around\nthe foreign body and provisionally seals the\ntyre.\nTyres with directional tread pattern\nAn arrow on the tyre sidewall indicates the\nrotation direction on directional tyres. Always\nnote the rotation direction indicated when\nmounting the wheel. This makes sure that op-\ntimal use is made of tyre properties in terms of\naquaplaning, grip, excessive noise and wear.\nRetrofitting of accessories\nIf you wish to change or fit wheels, rims or\nwheel trims, we recommend that you consult\nwith a specialised CUPRA Service or SEAT Offi-\ncial Service centre for advice regarding current\ntechnical recommendations.\n",

For this reason, final vehi-\ncle owners in the EU and in many other coun-\ntries are required by law to take their vehicle to\nan authorised collection point, vehicle return\ncentre or authorised dismantling facility.\nCUPRA has already made the necessary ar-\nrangements for this: an extensive network of\nvehicle return centres is available throughout\nthe EU and in many other countries, where you\ncan drop off your vehicle. If you meet the na-\ntional legal requirements, you can return your\nend-of-life vehicle free of charge within the\nEU.\nThe vehicle return centre issues a recycling\ncertificate which serves as proof that the end-\nof-life vehicle has been recycled correctly.\nInformation about the Vehicle Return Centres\ncan be obtained from your CUPRA dealer.\nScrapping\nThe relevant safety requirements must be ob-\nserved when scrapping the vehicle or its in-\ndividual components, e.g. airbag system and\nseatbelt tensioners.
